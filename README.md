# Predictive Modeling of Customer Churn in the Moroccan Banking Sector

This project aims to build an end-to-end Machine Learning solution to predict customer churn (attrition) in the banking sector.
<br>
## 📌 Project Overview

Originally inspired by a real-world use case in a major Moroccan bank, the objective is to identify customers at risk of leaving by detecting early behavioral signals and providing actionable insights for marketing and retention teams.<br>

The solution provides:
- Individual churn scoring
- Interactive web application
- Business dashboards for decision-making

> Note: For confidentiality reasons, real banking data and internal information cannot be shared.<br>

## 🚀 Methodology (CRISP-DM)
The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology:<br>

### 1. Business Understanding  
Defining churn in the context of retail banking and identifying key business indicators of customer disengagement.

### 2. Data Preparation 
🔹Merging and aggregating multiple datasets:
- Customer profile data
- Digital activity  
- Transaction history  
- Financial balances
- Average outstanding <br>
<img width="626" height="297" alt="Capture2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f9c257c-80e5-4dea-b3a3-8166bf1adf19" />


All datasets are transformed to obtain **one row per customer**.

### 3. Heuristic Labeling  
🔹Since no explicit churn label was available, a heuristic labeling strategy was implemented using business-inspired rules, mainly based on:
- Progressive decline in average balances  
- Prolonged inactivity 

This simulates real-world scenarios where churn labels are not directly observable.

### 4. Modeling  
🔹Several algorithms were tested using :
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest   
- XGBoost  
- CatBoost  

🔹CatBoost was selected for its:
- High performance on imbalanced data  
- Native handling of categorical variables  
- Robustness to missing values  

### 5. Evaluation  
🔹Final model performance:
- **Accuracy:** 86%  
- **ROC-AUC:** 0.93  
- **Recall (churn class):** 0.69  
- **Precision:** 0.79

## 📊 Key Results

- The model successfully identifies nearly **70% of at-risk customers**.  
- Feature importance analysis highlights strong behavioral drivers, such as:
  - Declining average balances  
  - Reduced transaction activity
